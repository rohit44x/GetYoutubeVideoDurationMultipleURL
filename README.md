# GetYoutubeVideoDurationMultipleURL
It is a C# program that reads a list of YouTube video URLs from a text file and calculates the total time length. This can be done by integrating YouTube's Data API (v3) to fetch video details like duration.

To run this, you'll need to:

Install the Google.Apis.YouTube.v3 NuGet package.
Replace "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY" with your actual YouTube Data API key.
Save your list of URLs in a text file (urls.txt).
